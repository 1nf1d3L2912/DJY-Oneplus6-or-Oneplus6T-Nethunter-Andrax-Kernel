# Known bugs and missing features

1、![Fail](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build%20Fail-red.svg)**One missing feature is Wireless extension compatibility. It's used for configuring external WIET. It can configure the power, mount/unmount, connecting, etc. through iwconfig command. I've tried to migrate modules for kernel 4.14 4.19 5.0 5.1 but didn't succeed. Every time I enable this module, the phone will continue to crush and reboot, until a WIET is connected via OTG. I checked the bootup log with and without this module, and the debug log seems to indicate that the WiFi chip firmware provided by the manufacture doesn't support this module. Please let me know if anyone can fix this, and I would deeply appreciate your help. The debug log is provided as follow:**

**![Click](https://img.shields.io/badge/Click-blue.svg)[click to download the debug logs](https://github.com/johanlike/DJY-Oneplus6-or-Oneplus6T-Nethunter-Andrax-Kernel/releases/download/Debuglog/Wireless.extension.compatibility-Debuglog.zip)**

2、**![Fail](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build%20Fail-red.svg)~~The 5G drivers for 8811au, 8812au, 8814au，8821au are still missing, but being considered to be migrated. Please await later versions.~~(Attempt aborted. I've tried multiple times totransport relevant modules in multiple versions, but it all goes wrong when packing. The error message is:**

```
erro：ioctl_cfg80211.c:816:6: error: passing argument 2 of ‘cfg80211_roamed’ from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types], notify_channel
```

**I Googled revelent information, and noticed that this problem is more than common and has no effective solution. I believe that this is because of the driver does not support kernel 4.9. Lacking required skills, I decided to give up on this attempt. If anyone can solve this problem or has any constructive ideas, please contact me. I've uploaded relevant codes to my corresponding repository.)**

**![Click](https://img.shields.io/badge/Click-blue.svg)[click to view the kernel codes](https://github.com/johanlike/DJY-Nethunter-Andrax-Kernel-Source)**

3、**Because of system as root in Android 9.0, and in order to maximize the compatability and portability,![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)I will add a command to delete `/system/system/app/Duo/Duo.apk` in the package![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)for it to be flashed over different versions of OOS. If you need it, you can download this app from Play Store. The following is files on system as root:**

**![Click](https://img.shields.io/badge/Click-blue.svg)[sysetm as root](https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/system-as-root)**

4、The script to automatically install Magisk cause unexpected bugs, which have led to unsuccessful flashing. There are temperory solutions but that's not what I'm after, so it still remains to be fixed.

* **This module is for any Android phone with magisk.**

* **This module stores all .apk files in `/sdcrad/apks/` , so if some .apk files are not installed properly, please proceed to this directory and install them manually.**

* **![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)If you need to add or delete any .apk files, please put the files in `/sdcrad/apks/` or remove the existing files. The automated procedure will detect the files and install them. After that use **

  `zip -r9 DJY.zip *`

  **to flash it.**

* If you'd like to modify the bootup animation, please replace the `/system/media/bootanimation.zip` file and use

  `zip -r9 DJY.zip *`

  to flash.

* This Magisk module is a collection of common applications, custom bootup animation and wireless firmware. I will commit my module to Magisk officials, by then you'd be able to download my module from the Magisk Manager app. Here is the module:

# Installation guide

* **1、![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)For the phone whose bootloader isn't unlocked, there steps are required before flashing TWRP**![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)

**Go to Settings>>>About phone>>>tap the Build number for 7 times to unlock the developer options>>>System>>>Developer options>>>Turn on USB Debug>>>Then connect the phone to your PC and run bootloader-unlock.sh/bat(under Linux use**

**`bash bootloader-unlock.sh`**

**under Window double click bootloader-unlock.bat)>>>choose YES**

* **2、![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)!!!Before installing you'll need to set up certain environment and install some tools. I have packed most of the things you'll need, please read this document carefully!!!![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)**

  **![Click](https://img.shields.io/badge/Click-blue.svg)[Click to view the installation tutorial](https://johanlike.github.io/DJY-Oneplus6-or-Oneplus6T-Nethunter-Andrax-Kernel/tools/)**

* **3、If you still don't know how to do it please refer to the video tutorial below:**

* **4、About the Kali Choot installation: personally I would recommend using Linux Deploy to install it for it can be set to always install the latest release. Of coures, youcan also choose to install kalifs-xx.xz package from Nethunter official site.**

  **![Click](https://img.shields.io/badge/Click-blue.svg)[Kali Chroot Install](https://johanlike.github.io/DJY-Oneplus6-or-Oneplus6T-Nethunter-Andrax-Kernel/tools/#kali-chroot-install)**



* **5、If you still don't understand how to flash and use this kernel please refer to the following instruction:如果你真的还是不会刷入和使用那么请看以下说明**

* **![Fack YOU](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fack%20YOU-yellow.svg)!!!You fucking stupid? A regular kernel flashing takes simply tow steps, and I wrote a huge load of articles, you still don't get it? If you can't read, can't you just fucking Google it?你他妈猪啊你，老子说明写那么详细，你TM都不会，其实就是正常的刷内核方式就TM两步老子给你写了三四个文档，百度谷歌总会吧？？？不会你TM玩蛋去吧你，来玩毛
Nethunter和hacker啊！！！![Fack YOU](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fack%20YOU-yellow.svg)**

# Common problems and solutions

**1、![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)If Nethunter app malfunction please install Nethunter terminal。**

**2、![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)If bootkali can't be correctly executed in adb shell or Android shell please flash the Magisk module again.**

**3、![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg)If you installed Kali with Linux Deploy APP and postgesql cannot start in MetaSploit Framwork, please reffer to the following codes. Same goes for the mysql problem.**

```
nano /usr/sbin/update-rc.d
# Blacklist
# postgresql disabled (comment)
